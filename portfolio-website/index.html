  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Maltiti Azindoo Alidu, an enthusiastic and purpose-driven professional with a background in Agriculture Technology (Biotechnology Option), community development, research, and digital innovation. Born and raised in Tamale, Ghana, with roots in Zabzugu, I bring a deep connection to rural communities and a lifelong commitment to empowering underserved populations through sustainable development, technology, and education.

<p>Since completing my Bachelor of Science degree from the University for Development Studies (UDS) in 2021, I have gathered a diverse portfolio of experiences. My National Service at the Savannah Agricultural Research Institute (CSIR-SARI) sharpened my skills in precision agriculture, laboratory analysis, data collection, and farmer engagement. Since then, I have served in various professional capacities—including roles as an enumerator, scientific technician, software development intern, insurance executive, customer support staff, and community volunteer. I am currently interning with Nobel as part of the AWS re/Start Program and undergoing professional training through multiple fellowships, including the Precision Quality Internship and the Power Learn Project's Software Development Scholarship.

<p>I am passionate about using digital tools and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. I leverage AI for research, data analysis, idea generation, and personal learning, which enhances both my academic and professional pursuits. I also founded a small poultry venture, blending agricultural knowledge with entrepreneurial grit—proof of my ability to create solutions that are locally grounded and economically viable.

<p>My strengths lie in data analysis, research, digital literacy, software development, and community facilitation. I have professional certifications in Generative AI, Project Management, Customer Experience, Crop Advisory, and Nonprofit Essentials. I have also studied topics like sustainability, business analysis, and artificial intelligence, which reflect my continuous learning attitude and growth mindset.

As a volunteer, I’ve contributed to CHPS compound outreach efforts and rural community education programs. I thrive in collaborative environments, especially those that require adaptation, cultural sensitivity, and solution-oriented thinking. I aspire to a career where I can lead innovative, tech-enabled initiatives that improve lives in rural and underserved communities in Ghana and across Africa.

<p>In the next few years, I see myself becoming a leader in the intersection of agriculture, digital technology, and community development. I am committed to life-long learning, mentorship, and impactful change, and I seek roles that allow me to combine technical expertise with human-centered service.</p>
